## Attendance and Session Logistics

### What do I need for each session?

**You need to bring your laptop and your laptop charger to every session**. Everything we will be doing will be done on your personal computer, so if you don't bring your laptop there will not be much for you to do, and we do not have spare laptops to hand out.

Also please ensure that you have Administrator privileges to your laptop, either by having access to your parent's user account, or having your user account be set to Administrator. Not having Administrator privileges will make it difficult for us to install programs during the sessions, and make it difficult to perform certain actions on your laptop.
### Where do I find information about which session I'm supposed to go to?

All information about sessions (regularly updated to let you know which room you're in) is available [here](https://canberragrammar.github.io/codecadets-2018/sessions)

### Do I need to attend every session?

Yep, if you miss a session you may miss important content that the next session might build upon!

### What do I do if I can't attend a session in a single week?

When you can't attend a session, have a look at the session list and see if you can find an alternative session. If the tutor is the same, contact your tutor and let them know which session you'll be attending and why you're switching for that week. If the tutor is different, you'll need to email *both* your tutor and the tutor who will be running the alternative session.

### What do I do if I need to switch sessions permanently?

When something about your timetable changes and you have different commitments on different days please get your parents to contact your tutor so that we can arrange a permanent solutions.

### What do I do if I need to leave a session early?

We prefer it if you stay for the whole session and ask that if you anticipate leaving early then consider switching to a different session for that particular week. If in doubt, contact your tutor before the session.

## Expectations

### We're making games, I'm allowed to play them right? Doesn't that mean I can play any games?

No. As tutors we're well aware of when a student is making a game and testing it against just playing games in the sessions. As with all other classes, you're violating the technology usage agreement you agree to as a student of Canberra Grammar if we find you're playing games that weren't developed by you or weren't aiding in your game development research (which requires prior permission).

If we find that you're violating the technology usage agreement we may contact your parents, your housemaster or you to remind you of our expectations of the sessions.

## Other Questions

### I feel as though I'm slipping behind on the content, is it worth staying on?

Definitely! These things happen and sometimes you can lose your way. Let [your tutor](#People) know that you're having difficulty keeping up or understanding something and we'll be happy to work through your troubles one-on-one.

### I can't do the set work this week, will I get a detention?

[Programming is hard](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/make-your-hobby-harder-programming-is-difficult-thats-why-you-should-learn-it-e4627aee41a1). High school can be one of the [most stressful](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/teen-stress.aspx) parts of growing up and it would be unfair to add another whole subject onto your already busy schedule. All we ask as tutors and as a program is for you to give it your all while you're with us and occasionally complete quizes and small tasks at home. The homework we set is merely to make sure everyone is on the same page, if you complete all the work in each session there will be no need to complete any further work at home.

### Where are sessions held?

Have a look at the regularly updated room and session schedule available [here](sessions.md).
