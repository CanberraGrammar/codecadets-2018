### The goal : Create a basic AI using scripts

* Using your previous script, control multiple objects.

* Using scripts to make objects act on their own.

* Create an object that follows the player


### Scripting multiple Objects

> Using your movement scripts from last week.

Create a new object in your Game world next to your controllable object from before.
