### Computing Fundamentals (Week 1 - 4)

### Programming in Practice (Week 5 - 6)

## Sessions

Each weekly session is released one week in advance.

### [Week One | Introduction to Code Cadets & Setup](one.md)

In our first week, we will be covering some of the fundemental skills you will require to be able to program effectively. We will also be setting up our computers and installing the necessary tools we will need for our first term.

###  [Week Two | Getting Started with Terminal](two.md)

During our second week, we will cover the Command Line Interface (Terminal for Mac, Linux Subsytem for Windows) and how to take advantage of it to streamline our programming experience.

###  [Week Three | Introduction to Git](three.md)

In this third week, we will learn how to use Git - an extremely powerful version control system that is used industry-wide in computer science. Git helps us keep track of changes to an ongoing project, and allows us to revert changes back incase we make a mistake.

###  [Week Four | Git in Practice and as a collaborative tool](four.md)

Our fourth week will be focussed on using Git in a practical way, by creating our first GitHub repository and covering more advanced aspects of Git such as Forking Repos & Resolving Merge Conflicts.

###  [Week Five | Introduction to C#](five.md)

An introduction to the C# language in preparation for moving onto to Unity. We'll mainly tackle syntax differences between C# and Python.

###  [Week Six | Programming Challenges](six.md)

For the final Week of Term 1 we've opted not to introduce any new concepts to you, but rather to keep C# in your mind by setting some challenge questions to test you understand C#.
